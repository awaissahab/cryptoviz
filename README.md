# CryptoViz - Interactive Cryptography Visualizer

An educational web application that visualizes cryptographic algorithms step-by-step, making complex encryption concepts accessible to beginners.

## Features

### 🎯 7 Cryptographic Algorithms

1. **Caesar Cipher** - Classical substitution cipher with shift values 1-25
2. **Vigenère Cipher** - Polyalphabetic cipher using a keyword
3. **XOR Cipher** - Bitwise encryption using XOR operation
4. **AES-256-GCM** - Modern symmetric encryption (educational simulation)
5. **Base64 Encoding** - Binary-to-text encoding scheme
6. **ROT13** - Self-inverse substitution cipher
7. **Binary Encoding** - Text to binary conversion

### 📚 Detailed Step-by-Step Visualization

Each algorithm shows 4-6 detailed steps including:

- **Original Input** - Display of plaintext/ciphertext
- **Key Processing** - How the key is prepared and used
- **Transformation Details** - Character-by-character or byte-by-byte breakdown
- **Visual Mappings** - Alphabet substitution tables, binary conversions, etc.
- **Final Result** - The encrypted/decrypted output

### 🎨 Rich Visual Components

- **Alphabet Mapping Tables** - Visual substitution maps showing letter transformations
- **Character-by-Character Breakdown** - See exactly how each letter changes
- **Binary Visualizations** - Byte values and binary representations
- **Data Tables** - Detailed operation tables for complex algorithms
- **Progress Indicators** - Step-by-step progress tracking

### 💡 Educational Tips

Each step includes contextual tips explaining:
- Historical context (e.g., Caesar cipher used by Julius Caesar)
- Mathematical concepts (e.g., why XOR is self-inverse)
- Real-world applications (e.g., where Base64 is used)
- Security implications (e.g., why AES-256 is unbreakable)

### 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation** - Caesar cipher validates shift values (1-25)
- **Error Handling** - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **Local Processing** - All operations run in browser, no data sent to servers
- **Robust Copy** - Multiple fallback methods for copying results

### 🎨 Design

- **Clean Dark Theme** - Easy on the eyes with zinc color palette
- **Responsive Layout** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Animations** - Steps animate in with fade and slide effects
- **Color-Coded Categories** - Classical (amber), Modern (blue), Encoding (purple)

## How to Use

1. **Select an Algorithm** - Click on any algorithm card
2. **Choose Mode** - Toggle between Encrypt and Decrypt
3. **Enter Input** - Type your plaintext or ciphertext
4. **Enter Key** (if required) - Provide the encryption key
5. **Click Process** - Watch the step-by-step transformation
6. **Copy Result** - Click the copy button to copy the output

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **All Processing**: Client-side only (no server required)

## Educational Value

This tool helps beginners understand:
- How encryption transforms data
- The difference between classical and modern cryptography
- Why certain algorithms are secure
- How keys work in encryption
- The mathematics behind cryptographic operations

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers with:
- Clipboard API support (with fallbacks)
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Privacy

All cryptographic operations are performed locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to any server.
